## Projects

<!-- You have to wrap the "left" and "right" half of these headings in spans by
hand -->
### <span>**Semi-supervised InfoGAN (under research)**</span> <span>Feb. 2019 -- Present</span>

Based on [[paper1]](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6399-infogan-interpretable-representation-learning-by-information-maximizing-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf) and [[paper2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.04487.pdf), investigated the effect of the input noise, and tried to interpret the parameters and the model, from the perspective of information theory.


### <span>**Gene Expression Prediction**</span> <span>Oct. 2018 -- Jan. 2019</span>

Based on [[paper]](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7255-attend-and-predict-understanding-gene-regulation-by-selective-attention-on-chromatin.pdf), reproduced the main works. Extract histone modifications from biological big data, train with CNN to predict gene expression. Also wrote some python and shell scripts for data preprocessing.

### <span>**Insurance Market Prediction**</span> <span>May 2018</span>

Using SVM to analyze the insurance company's history business, trying to 
predict customers who have insurance intentions, so as to maximize 
company profits.
